            advertising a Production of Romeo and Juliet.  It was inspired by the quote 'palm to palm is 
            holy palmers kiss'. I wanted the symbolism to be subtle and focused on typographical heirarchy,
            with the quote as most important, play name as second, public theatre third and the location info 
            last.">

            alt="This poster is one in a series of posters advertising a Production of Romeo and Juliet.  
            I wanted to break away from the stereotypical colors and symbols of the play such as roses, daggers,
            hearts etc, and do something unexpected.  In a subtle nod to Juilet's death, her name is buried 
            underground."

            src="assets/split hand poster.jpg" alt="This poster is one in a series of three 
            advertising a Production of Romeo and Juliet.  I was aiming to capture the feeling of unrest 
            and chaos in the play, where everything misaligns and goes wrong.  Tiny Romeo and Juliet are 
            trapped in a heart shaped bottle, that looks like either poision or love potion. A giant hand,
            symbolising the forces out of their control, is shaking the bottle.  Even the text is shaken 
            all out of place.">

            obsessed with this song 'Playing on My Mind' by the 1975, and I had this image in
            my mind of a girl with a record player in her skull, and decided to make it in 
            Illustrator using only shapes, to improve my skills.">

            Graphics class.  We were asked to find a picture of a watch and recreate it in Illustrator 
            as photo realistic as we possibly could.  To achieve this took many hours of work, hundreds
            of gradients, use of reflections, gaussian blur, and textures, to create the look of metal.">

                created by cleanly merging images in photoshop, with strong typographic heirarchy.">

                and I really love it because it reads so well and could make a cool ad with the right context. I 
                paid close attention to the details in this piece, matching the watch background to the page background, 
                creating unity and being consistent with apple's theme.">

                techniques, integrating textures, different images, adjustment filters, and putting the bottom text on 
                a path to form the subtle motion lines of romeo climbing up the balcony.">

            medicine on the right.  While creating these icons I polled random people and asked what they thought these 
            icons represented, and adjusted my designs until 95% of people guessed the correct word upon first seeing
            the icon.">

            working with to redesign their logo. These are only half of the ideas that I sent in, giving 
            them as much variety as possible, while still keeping in mind their vision and breif. They ended 
            up chosing and refining design #8.">

        <img class="showcase12 showcase styleModal" load=lazy id="image12" onclick="showModal('image12');"
            src="assets/rachel.gif" alt="This is a gif I created just for fun of my friend Rachel. It required
            cross platform creation- creating individual frames in illustrator, then using photoshop to combine 
            them and create a gif. It was fun to figure out how to create this and utilize tools that I didn't
            even know existed before this.">

        my mind of a girl with a record player in her skull.  I decided to make it in 
        Illustrator using only the shape tool, to improve my skills.">

        <img class="invisible" id="image6" src="assets/final album coverwhite.png" alt="This is a record
        album cover for Benny Goodman's song Chicago.  I listened to the song and was inspired
        by the smooth movement, and wanted to capture that feeling.  I was also inspired by that scene in 
        Ratatouille where he's tasting food and seeing the different colors pop up and move behind him, which 
        is kinda funny, but inspiration can come from anywhere.">

        <img class="invisible" id="image5" src="assets/both watches.jpg" alt="This is the infamous 
        watch project from Vector Graphics class.  We were asked to find a picture of a watch and
