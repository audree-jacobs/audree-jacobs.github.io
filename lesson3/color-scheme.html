 <h2> Color Scheme </h2>
 <img style="width:600px;" src="AdobeColor-weather 5.jpeg">
 <p> This color scheme is very brightly colored and must be offset with a lot of white space and simple black text.  The bright colors will mostly be used for headlines and small boxes as well as the navigation bar, and some images.  It goes well with the brightly colored logo.    </p>
