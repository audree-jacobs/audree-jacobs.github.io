    <h1> Weather Website Site Plan </h1>
    <div class="info">
        <h2> Site Name & Domain</h2>
        <p> The name of my site is going to be Idaho Nightime Forecasts, or I.N.F. for short.  
            Using google domains I found an available domain name for my site: nightimeforecast.com which 
            costs $12 a year. <br> <br> <br> </p>
        <h2> Site Purpose</h2>
        <p> The purpose of my website is to provide a weather forecast specifically focused 
            on accurate nightime predictions. My site is for people who want specific 
            information about the night.  This could be people who might want to camp or 
            stargaze or do other outdoor activities at night. Content I want to inculde is 
            the weather, ground temperature for campers, some star and moon information, 
            and alerts about possible dangerous situations. <br> <br> <br>
        </p>  
        <h2> Logo </h2>  
        <img class="logo" src="weather logo.png">
        <p> Here is my logo, I designed it myself using illustrator and I chose to do a 
            moon because my site has a night theme and it just made sense since it's talking
            about the weather at night. <br> <br> <br> 
        </p>
