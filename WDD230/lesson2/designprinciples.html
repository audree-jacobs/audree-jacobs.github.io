         <p class="content"> This website is a great example of textual visual hierarchy.  
             The first thing you look at on the page is the main title which says "Membership 
             Starts Here".  Fro there you're led to the paragraph, then the image, then back 
             up to the bright red menu.  The size of the first heading draws you to it, and then
            proximity leads you to the paragraph and the image, and then color contrast brings
            attention to the menu.  This is how the hierarchy works and moves your eye around the 
            page, starting with the most important heading.

         <p class="content"> The bottom section of this website I thought was a good example of 
             clean design and using white space. The different sections at the bottom are all
             formatted in the same, simple, black and white format, and the logos for the social 
             media are also all black and white.  This simplifies the content which is actually 
             a lot going on but the clean way it's formatted makes it simple and almost boring to
             look at, so it doesn't look to complicated. There's also a generous amount of space 
             from each line to the + symbol and inbetween lines and logos, so nothing feels crowded.

         <p class="content"> This is my favorite example because I just think they 
             did a realy great job and it looks really pretty.  The repitition of the 
             color purple from the image to the text box underneath it gives it a 
             cohesive look.  The main heading font is the same font as the logo at the 
             top of the page which adds another layer of repitition. All together the 
             design looks very unified and purposeful, and the colors espcially give it 
             a really cool look.
